# GuessANumberByCrim

Game where you have to guess number. The number is randomly generated and you have a certein level of difficulty and as of now, 2 levels to choose from.
For the future is planned to add an option where 2 player can compete with each other and maybe couple of more levels and variations of the game.

The game is made with python 3.12, in the game is used only the "random" library of python on JetBrains Pycharm Community Edition.
In the coding process i used functions, so it is easier in the future to change and adapt the code easily useable if repetiotion is needed.
